    <h1> What made Napoleon a successful commander  </h1>
 <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

  
  <h3>Napoleon was very successful for a variety of reasons.</h3>   
  
  <div>
  <p>He was very popular with his troops and they trusted him completely. This started because he proved to his troops that he was willing to put himself in the line of danger along with them. In one of his earlier campaigns as a general in Italy he took over the duty of sighting a cannon (a corporals job) after the corporal was killed. He also made sure that his men had everything they needed for combat. Knowing that an army marches on its stomach he always made sure his men were well fed. Also naturally as he gained more victories his men admired him more and more.</p>

  <h3>Organization</h3>
  <p> Napoleon was very good at organizing his armies. While most armies of the time were a huge mass of troops commanded by a central body, Napoleon split his armies into separate Corps that were each individually commanded by their own general or field marshal. This allowed each corp to maneuver much faster because one commander would control a smaller force rather than have to worry about organizing a huge army by themselves. Each corp also traveled within 1 days march of each other so if any corp were to meet overwhelming force another corp could be there to re-enforce them very quickly. he also stuidied the likes of Alexander the Great,Mehmed the conqueror and great Roman generals.

  <h3>Strategy</h3>
  <p>Napoleon had 2 big strategies, divide and conquer as well as misdirection. Napoleon was overly aggressive. If he found that armies were coming to attack him, he'd move his armies as fast as possible to attack the opposing forces before they could group with each other. There were many times where several countries banded together to fight Napoleon and their combined forces were more than double the size of Napoleon's. To counter this Napoleon would attack them separately in engagements where his forces outnumbered theirs.</p>

<h3>The Coalitions</h3>
    <p>Napoleon was such a good military leader he took nearly all of Euope very early on in his campaign the English seen this rise in French power and started a coalition to stop him this strong military force Britain, Russia, Prussia, Spain, Holland, and Austria. This was a very strong military force for the time but because of Napleons military leadership and great stategy's he was able to defeat this Coalition</p>

    <p>After the fail of the first coalition the English went on to make 7 more in order to defeat this new power in Europe. </p>
