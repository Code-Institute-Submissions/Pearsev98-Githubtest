  <h1> Napoleon's defeat</h1>
  <h3> The 6th Coalition</h3>
  <br>
<p>In the War of the Sixth Coalition (March 1813 – May 1814), sometimes known in Germany as the War of Liberation, a coalition of Austria, Prussia, Russia, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Sweden, Spain and a number of German States defeated France and drove Napoleon into exile on Elba. After the disastrous French invasion of Russia of 1812 in which they had been forced to support France, Prussia and Austria joined Russia, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Portugal and the rebels in Spain who were already at war with France. The War of the Sixth Coalition saw major battles at Lützen, Bautzen, and Dresden. The even larger Battle of Leipzig was the largest battle in European history before World War I. Ultimately, Napoleon's earlier setbacks in Portugal, Spain, and Russia proved to be the seeds of his undoing. With their armies reorganized, the allies drove Napoleon out of Germany in 1813 and invaded France in 1814. The Allies defeated the remaining French armies, occupied Paris, and forced Napoleon to abdicate and go into exile.</p>

  <h3>Napoleon Return From Exile</h3>


  <p>In March 1815, he escaped his island exile and returned to Paris, where he regained supporters and reclaimed his emperor title, Napoleon I, in a period known as the Hundred Days. why it was called 100 days is strange seeming that this event took 110 days.</p>

  
<p>After his exile Naploen returned to France and delared himself emperor once again the French sent there amries to stop Napoleon but there loyalty to him was shown as they joined his forces in the <span>in search for a greater France</span>
Napolens men where happy to see there leader and joined his forces to retake his empire he spent the last 15 years making, his men fell to there knees and where happy to join him when he came back from exile </p>

  <h3>The Battle of Waterloo</h3>
  <p>Facing The Duke of Wellington (an Irish born commander) Napolen used his normal tactics that seemed to work during his long reign as Emperor he sent most of his troops to attack one side of The Duke of Wellintons army in hopes that The Duke would re enfource his troops on that side so that Napolen could send the strongest part of his army to the weak side of the Dukes but un knowing to Napolen The Duke had studied Napoleons tactics and was ready for this action along with the fact the the French troops would have been very fatuiged and outnumbered Napoleon underestamted The Duke of Wellington and lost this battle tuss ending the Napolonic Wars and his reign as French Emperor</p>

  <h3>Why he lost this battle</h3>
  <p>In the first view, historians claim that the French loss at Waterloo was a direct result of Napoleon's own leadership blunder and inferior methods of warfare. The second argument claims that Napoleon was defeated mainly due to the superior strategy and tactics of his enemies, the Prussians and Anglo-Allies.</p>
  <ul>
    <ol>His men where weaked from the last years of War</ol>
    <ol>While he was an amazing commander his tactics where stuided</ol>
    <ol>He underestimated The Duke of Wellington</ol>
  </ul>
  
  <br>
<h3>After His Final Defeat</h3>
  <p>After his defeat in Waterloo Napoolen was exiled to a far away Island from France a place called island of Saint Helena where he would spend the rest of his days living in a small house, but his love for France never left him as he kept a French flag outside his house </p>
